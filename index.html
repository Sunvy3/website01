        <h1 class="display-2">SOCIAL MEDIA IS MAKING YOU INTO AN ASSHOLE</h1>
        <p class="display-6">Let me rephrase this argument’s title. I don’t know you. I’m
                not saying that you
                personally
                are definitely turning into an asshole, but many people are, yet they seem to only see that many other
                people are. I’ve seen myself start turning into an asshole online, and it was scary and depressing. So
                what I should really say is something like “You’re vulnerable to gradually turning into an asshole, or
                statistically you might very well be turning into an asshole. So, no offense, but please take the
                possibility seriously.”<br>

                Fake news spreads six times faster than true news. According to researchers, this is because fake news
                grabs our attention more than authentic information: fake news items usually have a higher emotional
                content and contain unexpected information which inevitably means that they will be shared and reposted
                more often.
        </p>
        <p class="display-6">
                The primary driving force behind whether someone will share a piece of information is not its accuracy
                or even its content; the main reason we share a post is because it comes from a friend or a celebrity
                with whom we want to be associated. As humans, we’re often more concerned with status, popularity, and
                establishing a trusted “friends” circle, than with maintaining the truth. As a result, social media
                spaces will inevitably be spaces where the truth is easily downgraded.
