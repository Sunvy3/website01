        <p id="poem">But there with all the jackals, panthers, hounds,<br>
                The monkeys, scorpions, the vultures, snakes,<br>
                Those howling, yelping, grunting, crawling brutes,<br>
                The infamous menagerie of vice,<br>
                One creature only is most foul and false!<br>
                Though making no grand gestures, nor great cries,<br>
                He willingly would devastate the earth<br>
                And in one yawning swallow all the world;<br>
                He is Ennui!*—with tear-filled eye he dreams<br>
                Of scaffolds, as he puffs his water-pipe.<br>
                Reader, you know this dainty monster too;<br>

        <h1>THE DIOGENES CONUNDRUM</h1>
        <p>Almost two and a half millennia ago, the outrageous Diogenes told his students that when he died he wanted
                his body to be tossed over the wall where it would be devoured by beasts. He was gone; it no longer
                mattered to him. Diogenes was right (his or any body forever stripped of life can not be injured), but
                also existentially wrong, wrong in a way that defies all cultural logic. The dead body matters, it
                matters because the living need the dead far more than the dead need the living. It matters because the
                dead make social worlds. It matters because we cannot bear to live at the borders of our mortality. <br>
                <em>-Thomas Laqueur, “The Work of the Dead” (2015)</em>

        <h1>SOCIAL MEDIA IS MAKING YOU INTO AN ASSHOLE</h1>

        <p>
                Let me rephrase this argument’s title. I don’t know you. I’m not saying that you personally are
                definitely turning into an asshole, but many people are, yet they
                seem to only see that many <em>other</em> people are. I’ve seen myself start turning into an asshole
                online, and it was scary and depressing.
                So what I should really say is something like “You’re vulnerable to gradually
                turning into an asshole, or statistically you might very well be turning into an
                asshole. So, no offense, but please take the possibility seriously.” <br>
