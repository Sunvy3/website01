        <h1>THE DIOGENES CONUNDRUM</h1>
        <p>Almost two and a half millennia ago, the outrageous Diogenes told his students that when he died he
            wanted
            his body to be tossed over the wall where it would be devoured by beasts. He was gone; it no
            longer
            mattered to him. Diogenes was right (his or any body forever stripped of life can not be
            injured), but
            also existentially wrong, wrong in a way that defies all cultural logic. The dead body matters,
            it
            matters because the living need the dead far more than the dead need the living. It matters
            because the
            dead make social worlds. It matters because we cannot bear to live at the borders of our
            mortality. <br>
