        <h1 class="">WELCOME TO THE CAGE THAT GOES EVERYWHERE WITH YOU</h1>
        <p class="">Something entirely new is happening in the world. Just in the last five or ten
                years, nearly everyone started to carry a little device called a smartphone on their
                person all the time that’s suitable for algorithmic behavior modification. A lot of
                us are also using related devices called smart speakers on our kitchen counters or
                in our car dashboards. We’re being tracked and measured constantly, and
                receiving engineered feedback all the time. We’re being hypnotized little by little
                by technicians we can’t see, for purposes we don’t know. We’re all lab animals
                now.<br>
