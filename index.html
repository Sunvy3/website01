        <h1 class="">SOCIAL MEDIA IS MAKING YOU INTO AN ASSHOLE</h1>
        <p class="">Let me rephrase this argument’s title. I don’t know you. I’m
                not saying that you
                personally
                are definitely turning into an asshole, but many people are, yet they seem to only see that many other
                people are. I’ve seen myself start turning into an asshole online, and it was scary and depressing. So
                what I should really say is something like “You’re vulnerable to gradually turning into an asshole, or
                statistically you might very well be turning into an asshole. So, no offense, but please take the
                possibility seriously.”<br>
